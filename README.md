# Code for each video
The code in branch `master` reflects the final state of our Bobooks app that we are gradually building throughout our course.
As you go through the course videos you might want to checkout the corresponding branch:
* Section 1 Video 1 - checkout branch `section1/1_first_LINQ`
...
* Section 5 Video 1 - checkout branch `section5/1_pure_functions`
  * in many cases there are "Before" branches i.e. `section5/1_pure_functions-Before` - these are the stepping stone usually shown in the video and being worked on to become the proper version - in this case `section5/1_pure_functions`
